Bigmouth Strikes Again
The Smiths

Sweetness
Sweetness, I was only joking
When I said: I'd like to
Smash every tooth in your head

Oh, sweetness
Sweetness, I was only joking
When I said: By rights, you
Should be bludgeoned in your bed

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her Walkman started to melt

Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh)

Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race

And now I know how Joan of Arc felt
Now I know how Joan of Arc felt
As the flames rose to her roman nose
And her hearing aid started to melt

Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh)

Bigmouth, oh-ho-ho, ha-ha
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh)

Bigmouth, oh-ho-ho, ha ha
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh)

Bigmouth, la-da-da-da-da
Bigmouth, la-da-da-da
Bigmouth strikes again
And I've got no right to take my place
With the human race (oh)
