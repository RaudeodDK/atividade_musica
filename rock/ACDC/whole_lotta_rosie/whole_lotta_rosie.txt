Whole Lotta Rosie
AC/DC

Wan' tell you a story
'Bout a woman I know
Ah, come to lovin'
She steals the show

She ain't exactly pretty
Ain't exactly small
42, 39, 56
You could say she's got it all

Never had a woman
Never had a woman like you
Doin' all the things
Doin' all the things you do

Ain't no fairy story
Ain't no skin and bones
But you give it all you got
Weighin' in at 19 stone

You're a whole lotta woman
A whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
And you're a whole lotta woman

Oh, honey, you can do it
Do it to me all night long
Only one that turn me
Only one that turn me on

All through the nighttime
And right around the clock
Oh, to my surprise
Rosie never stopped

She was a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
A whole lotta woman
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Oh, you're a whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta Rosie
You're a whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman-man-man-man-man
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Whole lotta Rosie
Whole lotta woman
Whole lotta woman
